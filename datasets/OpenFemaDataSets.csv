The dataset includes declared recovery programs and geographic areas (county not available before 1964; Fire Management records are considered partial due to historical nature of the dataset). 

Please note the unique structure of the disaster sequencing (due to a numbering system that originated in the 1950's-1970's):
0001-1999     Major Disaster Declaration
2000-2999     Fire Management

openfema-11,HazardMitigationGrantProgramPropertyAcquisitions,Hazard Mitigation Grant Program Property Acquisitions,"This dataset lists properties from completed acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP). The HMGP provides grants to states and local governments to implement long-term hazard mitigation measures after a major disaster declaration. Acquisition projects funded under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) are voluntary and one is under no obligation to sell their home. Acquisition projects are based on the principle of fair compensation for property. Property acquisitions present owners with an opportunity to recoup a large part of their investment in property that probably has lost some, if not most of its value due to damage after a disaster. Under the Stafford Act, any land purchased with Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds must be restricted to open space, recreational, and wetlands management uses in perpetuity

Acquisition or Buyout projects, while 75 percent funded by FEMA, are administered by the State and local communities. FEMA does not buy properties directly from the property owners. Communities may offer homeowners who agree to participate in a buyout project up to the fair market value of the home before the disaster struck. A licensed appraiser hired by the community determines the fair market value. No one is obligated to sell their home; these are transactions and prices that both the property owner and communities agreed on. For More information on HMGP please visit http://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-program and HMGP FAQs http://www.fema.gov/hazard-mitigation-grant-programs-frequently-ask-questions.

ND and AFG are awarded and managed differently within GPD and should be treated with discretion.

The only measure in this data set is Award Amount. It is an additive measure that can be applied across multiple dimensions to create various views of the data.

AFG awards are assigned to individual Fire Departments. ND Grants are typically assigned to state agencies; however, exceptions do exist such as Port Security Security Grant Program which is assigned to port areas and not States. It is important to know that when looking at Award Amount by State it does not mean the State actually recieved that money. In addition, some grant programs may have pass-through requirements where the recipient State is required to sub-grant a minimum amount of the award and only retain a portion of the award.

Grants guidance is described in the Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA). Each grant program has its own grant guidance containing eligibility requirements, program objectives, and funding restrictions which are published annually. FOAs are public documents and may be found online at www.fema.gov/grants.

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. &sect;&sect; 5121 et seq.). Title VI of the Stafford Act authorizes FEMA to make grants for the purpose of providing a system of emergency preparedness for the protection of life and property in the United States from hazards and to vest responsibility for emergency preparedness jointly in the federal government and the states and their political subdivisions. The FY 2016 EMPG will provide federal funds to assist state, local, tribal and territorial emergency management agencies to obtain the resources required to support the National Preparedness Goal's (NPG's) (the Goal's) associated mission areas and core capabilities. The federal government, through the EMPG Program, provides necessary direction, coordination, and guidance, and provides necessary assistance, as authorized in this title to support a comprehensive all hazards emergency preparedness system.

The Emergency Management Performance Grant Program is to support a comprehensive, all-hazard emergency preparedness system by building and sustaining the core capabilities contained in the National Preparedness Goal.
Examples include: 
* Completing the Threat and Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (THIRA) process;
* Strengthening a state or community's emergency management governance structures; 
* Updating and approving specific emergency plans;
* Designing and conducting exercises that enable whole community stakeholders to examine and validate core capabilities and the plans needed to deliver them to the targets identified through the THIRA;
* Targeting training and verifying identified capabilities; 
* Initiating or achieving a whole community approach to security and emergency management.

The information is likely available as part of the paper file which is considered the file of record.

FEMA administers three programs that provide funding for eligible mitigation planning and projects to reduce disaster losses and protect life and property from future disaster damages. The three programs are the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP), Flood Mitigation Assistance (FMA) grant program, and Pre-Disaster Mitigation (PDM) grant program. This dataset also contains data from the HMA grant programs that were eliminated by the Biggert Water Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 (BW-12): Repetitive Flood Claims (RFC) grant program and Severe Repetitive Loss (SRL) grant program.

openfema-23,IndividualAssistanceHousingRegistrantsLargeDisasters,Individual Assistance Housing Registrants Large Disasters,"1.1. What is the data in the submission?

Individual Assistance is provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to individuals and families who have sustained losses due to disasters. 

Homeowners, renters, and business owners in designated counties who sustained damage to their homes, vehicles, personal property, businesses, or inventory as a result of a federally declared disaster may apply for disaster assistance. 

Disaster assistance may include grants to help pay for temporary housing, emergency home repairs, uninsured and underinsured personal property losses, and medical, dental, and funeral expenses caused by the disaster, along with other serious disaster-related expenses. 

Disaster assistance grants are not taxable income and will not affect eligibility for Social Security, Medicaid, medical waiver programs, welfare assistance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, or Social Security Disability Insurance. 

This dataset contains detailed non-PII data on the Individuals and Households Program (IHP). FEMA provides assistance to individuals and households through the Individual Assistance (IA) program, which includes all of the following: Mass Care and Emergency Assistance (MC/EA); Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program (CCP); Disaster Unemployment Assistance (DUA); Disaster Legal Services (DLS); Disaster Case Management (DCM); and Individuals and Households Program (IHP). IHP is comprised of two categories of assistance: Housing Assistance (HA) and Other Needs Assistance (ONA). For more information read FEMA's IHP unified guidance: https://www.fema.gov/ihp-unified-guidance 

Individual data elements and descriptions are listed in the metadata information within the dataset.

1.2. How is it generated? 

The data is derived from the National Emergency Management Information System (NEMIS). The system has been used since 1998 to process all cases for FEMA's Individual Assistance (IA) program as the system of record. The dataset was extracted using FEMA's Enterprise Data Warehouse to ensure reliable, uniform data. 

1.3. How can the data be used? 

The data can be used to analyze FEMA's IA program response attributes. This could particularly help local and state governments and non-governmental organizations put together applications for funding from the Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) program for rebuilding efforts during and after major disaster declarations. This data was instrumental in Hurricane Sandy community rebuilding and is designed for use in the 2017 hurricane season recovery and beyond.

OpenFEMA customers can comprehensively identify data trends that demonstrate needs of particular communities. For example, large numbers of households with elderly residents in areas susceptible to flooding who may need specific design considerations in home elevation, or low-income renters concentrated in communities where additional assistance may be needed to improve recovery.

Community groups in Texas assisting survivors with their recovery must have accurate and comprehensive data to allocate resources and design recovery programs to accurately and fairly meet the true needs of Texans, particularly the most vulnerable households and communities. The public must have access to this data in order to understand and evaluate state and local recovery plans, and advocate for an effective and equitable recovery.
